## Getting Started

To get started with the Google Maps Scraper, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Zubdata/Google-Maps-Scraper.git
   ```

### 2. Setup the Environment for Scraper

- For Windows, run:
  ```bash
  ./setup_win.cmd
   ```
- For Linux, run:
   ```
   ./setup_linux.sh
   ```

   It will auto install the dependencies

## 3. Install the Driver

   - If you already have a driver compatible with your Chrome browser, specify the driver path in `app/settings.py`.
   - If you don't have a driver, the scraper will automatically install it.
   - If the automatic installation fails, download the driver from the [Chrome Official Page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) and specify the driver path in `app/settings.py`. And then re-run the scraper.

### 3. Run the scraper:
   ```shell
   python app/run.py
   ```
